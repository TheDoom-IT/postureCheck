# Posture Check
---
I needed an Android app, which would help me to keep a good posture while using a computer. I decided to create such an app by my own.
### Build with
---
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework
* Android Studio

### How it works
---
The application plays a sound every chosen number of minutes to remind an user to keep a good posture.

The app can't work while the screen is off (it is suspended by the Android system). That's why, when the timer is active, the screen won't go off automatically. I implemented "Darken screen" option, which decrease the brightness of screen to minimum to minimize a battery usage.

### Future updates
---
This is my first Android application. Therefore, I still do not know how to prevent an Android system from suspending the app, when the screen is off. This issue was bypassed by "Darken screen", but in the future I would like to find a proper solution.
